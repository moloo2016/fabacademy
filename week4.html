                    <p>The files were downloaded from Fabisp <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabisp/">here</a>  the files were in different formats of schematics and brd. Use Eagle to open them in ordr to create Gerber Files.

                        After the generation of the Gerber files, transfer the gerber files to

                        <p>
                From here, we need to create a milling data and save it . it will automatically take the default extention.
                        In our case we use the Computer Controlled Drilling and Milling Machine and the RoutePro 3000 to do the milling and drilling.
                        I did all the settings and trying them fro the base, thickness under general; I the X and Y offsets leaving the scale at 10. The material settings were abit obvious leaving them at Length 160, Width 100 and Thichness of the copper at 1.36mm.</p>

                        <p>From here, I proceeded to the Machine where, I fixed the the workpiece on top of the base (sacrificial board). Unfortunately the cello tate I was using was not sticky enoufg and the pcb was not so flat on the board. This was evident as some lines could be milled dipper compared to other.<br>

                            After the milling, I brushed off the dusts and here is my finished board
    
    Apart from Computer Controlled Milling of PCB, I opted to try the <strong>Etching also known as the (Wet Process) process</strong> to compare the results. Here, below were the processes;
    <li> After the download of the artwork as per the assignment, printing it either by using kiCAD or IsoCAM.
        <ol>Open the board file onto Eagle</ol>
        <ol>Generate Gerber files</ol>
        <ol>Use IsoCAM or KiCAD to print making sure that it is dark enough</ol>
        </li>
        <img src="img/et1.jpeg" alt="Print out" width="600px" height="400px"/>
        <li>Exposing the artwork on the board. 
            <ol>you let the vacuum to hold the PCB firmly</ol>
            <ol>Turn on the lights for the set time; in this case it was 2 mins</ol>
            <ol>Once you are done, move to the next process</ol></li>
            <li>Etching Station
                
                       <img src="img/et3.jpeg" alt="Finished work" width="600px" height="400px"/>
                <img src="img/et2.jpeg" alt="Etching" width="600px" height="400px"/>
                
                                                                                              
                <ol>Here, dip the PCB in the developer and continuously chech if done</ol>
                <ol>Echant is the next stage where the temperature is monitored as the chemical disolves away the copper; 21 degrees celcius for 3 minutes was used</ol>
                <ol>Now the PCB is ready and wash it clean in the available water</ol></li>
        </p>

    <p><strong>Lessons learnt</strong><br>
    On the second trial I followed all the processed above well but when it comes to settings, I did not get it correctly and realised that it was milling much dipper aand so I stopped the work from the comp to work on the settings. I did not remember to replace the test tools in their correct positions and chuck before restarting . This error became very expensive when our Test tool broke in the process</p>
