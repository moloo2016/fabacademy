                    <p>During this week, I learnt alot of other designing/modelling softwares for 2D and 3D. At start, I wnt through My paint, Photoshop and Gimp. I could not learn much about them owing the time factor</p>

                    <p>For the vectors, I chose to use Inkscape after looking through others like QCAD, Libre CAD and Illustrator. Working with Inscape gave me opportunity of making my Final Project sketch easily.</p>

                    <p>For 3D I explored on blender which seemed so challenging. I came up with this shapeless design as a process of learning.The others am yet to learn includes Rhino, Grasshopper, Fusion 360, Auto Desk and Solid works</p>
