                    <p><strong>ARO FABLAB</strong> was founded in 2009 under ARC-KENYA, a local NGO with the mission of fighting poverty by doing things differently.This is how the Fablab was started in the rural parts of Siaya County in Majiwa</p>
                     <p>We provide a space for local entreprenuers, designers, craftsmen, Engineers,educators, students and all other creative thinkers where they can test their curocity under support from other Fablabers.</p>

                    <p>Apart from the FABLAB, ARC KENYA also run other programs including;
                    <ol>&#9679; Child Care Program</ol>
                    <ol>&#9679; Child Protection Program</ol>
                    <ol>&#9679; Agriculture Program &amp;</ol>
                    <ol>&#9679; Enviromental Management</ol>
                    
                    Under this, Fablab plays a central role of repairing the solar lamps distributed in the community by the Organization. Fablab also in partnership with Kisumu Polytechnic Engineering Department continues research on possible solar cooker</p><br>

                    <p>Being situated in the rural part of the country which also experience high poverty level, same predicaments have always followed our Fablab. Very few people realise the usefulness of the lab and even the technical schools available are several Kilometres away.</p>
                <p>Our Fablab prides itself with introducing Fablab Concept among the children in ARC KENYA Child Care Program as well as the Community. The Program is dubbed 'FABKIDS. It is run every Saturday where the children learn simple designing, Screen Printing and Basic Electronics. The children from the CCP has a program called Skills for Life where their do practical vocational trainings ranging from Carpentry, Tailoring, Catering, Agribusiness and Fabkids. Most of our children are doing well and don't want to miss the program</p><br>

            <p>Apart from the above, ARO Fablab have fabricated afew things in the past. These include earings made from the mangoe seed, simple footwares including the much talked about- OBAMA SHOE. The Obama Shoe was done with help of the then visiting Fablaber Jens Dyvik of  <a href="http://www.fellesverkstedet.no/">Fellesverktedet Fablab</a> Fablab-Norway. In his around the world visit to Fablabs and Hack Spaces, he had visited Fablab Kamakura-Japan before coming to ARO Fablab where he learnt how they were making shoes from their lab. He then help requesting for the files for the shoes which flew digitally to our Lab then an engravement of President Obama's image was added. More designs came up and additions to the designs including usage of Fish skin as inner sole. This concept blew big when the shoe was presented to Mama Sarah Obama whose home is just few kilometres way and Jens further used it in a big presentation at TEDx Copenhagensalon<a href="https://youtu.be/tVnCb-zCXxw">Obama Shoe</a><br> and

            <p>Other Projects done include prototyping gravity light where the gears were cut from from a board and simple wiring done.</p>
            <p>In the recent past, our lab decided to help bring a simple solution to motocycle riders'(major means of transport in the rural area) mobile phone charging challenge. The goal was to ensure their phones are charged as they work and so the concept was introduction of small DC (Direct Current) CHARGER which then get conneted to the wetcell directly and they use to charge their phones while at work. This was considered a relief the riders and their customers who at times miss them while their phone are off due to lack of power</p>

                    <P>This is my Fab Academy Lab. It is an excellent spaace with good fabrication machines and a perfect collection of professionals. This is one of the rare spaces in Kenya that welcomes makers, designers and innovators and support them to their causes. It has a strong and focused leadership and I hope it would mould me for the better</P> <a href="http://gearbox.co.ke/">Gearbox</a><br><br>
