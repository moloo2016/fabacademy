                    <p>This has been another interesting week for me. I learnt a lot .I learnt the two major machines here; laser cutter and the vinyl cutter. 
                        After viewing other parametric press fits for former students' files <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/students/">Students Achive</a> and other  sites like for Epilog laser and Instructables, I came up with my design as below;

<strong>Plans</strong>
Machine  used: laser cutter 
                        Material  used: Acrylic material with thickness of 6mm </p>

                <a style="color:red">The Parametric press - fit Constructions Drawings</a>
                 <img src="img/presfitfinal.svg" alt="Diagram" width="400px" height="600px"/>
                    </p>

                <p>This was done with Inkscape. 
Here, tools like like path nodes editor and Bezier for curves and straight lines was so helpful. Also used the Measurement tool, rectangle &amp; square tools.
The drawing wasnt good enough following the challenge with the tool for editing nodes on paths.



 Even-though it provides an opportunity for the 3D image viewing, I still went ahead to try other software and this landed me to CorelDraw. This is a superb tool for the 2D designing like for the one I was doing.</p><br>

                <h3 style="color:green">Project description</h3>
                    <p>The Pressfit I made is globe-shaped in completion (see the image below). It has  five (5) different shapes and sizes cutouts. These small pieces are able to fit into each other fit enough.</p>
                                                                                           
<p>
                <h3>Below are the measurements of the pieces;</h3>
                <ol>
1.The connector measures 45x45mm. They are square with a notch on each side measuring 10x5mm</ol>
                <ol>
2. The cutouts which make the pressfits measures 120x20mm. These will be 4 in number and will be joining the 'North and South poles'</ol>
                 <ol>
3. For the outer curves; they are rectangular 8 pieces measuring 80x30mm.</ol>
             <ol>
4. Inner connectors; these are 4 small pieces measuring 30x10mm. They connect the 'North/South' pole pieces to the horizontal piece</ol>
         <ol>
                5. Middle connectors, they are also 4 pieces connecting the curves to the centre pieces. They have notches on both length sides closser to the end measuring 5x5mm each and one measuring 5x10mm on the other width side away from the previous ones. this side connects to the centre. They measures 20x80mm each.</ol>

<br><strong>Lessons learnt</strong><br>
I managed to manouver through the corel draw so comfortably. I perfected myself in usage of measurements. I can now handle most tools of corelDraw.
I realised that I need more practice with other relevant programs and especially Inkscape which I have been regarding to be so easy to manipulate.
In my initial stages of imaginating what to design, I hade to use small hard papers to cut them physically using a pair of scisors at home just to make sure that my imagination can be actualized and done practically. I guess that if I continue practicing the 3D programs, I will better do it next time but it was a grat experience.

<br>Our laser cutter still have breakdown but will be able to do practicals soon it is repaired.
